# 🚨 CRITICAL: Next.js 15 Compatibility Issue

## ❌ **The Problem**
You're using **Next.js 15.5.0**, which is very recent and may have compatibility issues with Clerk.

## ✅ **Immediate Fix Options**

### **Option 1: Downgrade to Next.js 14 (Recommended)**
```bash
# Stop server first
npm install next@14.2.5 react@18 react-dom@18
npm run dev
```

### **Option 2: Update Clerk to Latest Version**
```bash
npm install @clerk/nextjs@latest
npm run dev
```

### **Option 3: Check Clerk Next.js 15 Support**
1. Visit [Clerk Next.js Documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/nextjs)
2. Check if Next.js 15 is officially supported
3. Look for any special configuration needed

## 🔍 **Why This Happens**
- Next.js 15 was released very recently
- Clerk may not have full compatibility yet
- New App Router features might conflict
- Server components behavior changed

## 🧪 **Test After Fix**
1. Visit `/simple-test` - Should show proper Clerk components
2. Visit `/sign-up` - Should show signup form
3. Visit `/admin` - Should redirect to sign-in if not authenticated

## 🆘 **If Still Not Working**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Try the domain configuration fix first
3. Consider using Next.js 14 for now
4. Check Clerk GitHub issues for Next.js 15

## 📱 **Recommended Approach**
1. **First**: Try the domain configuration fix
2. **Second**: Update Clerk to latest version
3. **Third**: Downgrade to Next.js 14 if needed
4. **Fourth**: Wait for official Clerk Next.js 15 support

**Next.js 15 compatibility is likely the root cause!**

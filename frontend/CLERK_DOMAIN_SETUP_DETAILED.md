- **Applications** → **Your App** → **Settings** → **Domains**

### **Path C:**
- **Your App** → **Configuration** → **Domains**

- `localhost:3000` in the list
- Status: Active/Verified

## 🚨 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue 1: Can't Find Settings**

- Check if you're in the right application
- Try refreshing the page

### **Issue 2: Can't Find Domains**
- Look under "General" settings

- Look for "Environment" or "Deployment"

### **Issue 3: Domain Already Exists**
- If `localhost:3000` is already there, you're good!

## 🧪 **After Adding Domain**

1. **Go back to your terminal**
2. **Stop your server**: Press `Ctrl + C`
3. **Restart your server**: `npm run dev`
4. **Test the fix**:
   - Visit `/simple-test` - Should show Clerk components
   - Visit `/sign-up` - Should show signup form
   - Visit `/admin` - Should redirect to sign-in

1. **Take a screenshot** of your Clerk dashboard
2. **Look for these keywords** in the sidebar:
   - Settings
   - Configuration
   - General
   - Domains
   - Environment

## 🎯 **Success Indicators**

You'll know it's working when:
